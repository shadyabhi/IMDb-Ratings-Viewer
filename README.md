# About the Extension

Show ratings when you open actor's page in IMDb. This extension uses Kango framework (http://kangoextensions.com/) to write cross-browser extension.

# Motivation

If you are a movie freak, a day won't pass when you won't open an actor's page and find more movies to watch. The actor's page has the list of all the movies in which he acted but for some reason IMDb doesn't show the movie ratings with it. I feet too lazy to open each links and watch the rating. So, this extension is a solution for that.

The ratings of movies are shown beside the names of the movies and after installing there will not be any need to open movie's link in new tab just to watch the rating.
