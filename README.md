# About the script

Show ratings when you open actor's page in IMDb
Initially made for Chrome but it works on Firefox too as a greasemonkey script.

# Motivation

If you are a movie freak, a day won't pass when you won't open an actor's page and find more movies to watch. The actor's page has the list of all the movies in which he acted but for some reason IMDb doesn't show the movie ratings. I feet to lazy to open each links and watch the rating.

 So, I wrote this extension to ease up the process. The ratings of movies are shown beside the names of the movies and after installing there will not be any need to open movie's link in new tab just to watch the rating.
